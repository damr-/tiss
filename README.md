# Tiss Tool
A small program to aid myself in choosing courses for my master's programme in physics.

It fetches the courses from the course-list website ("Tiss") and sorts them according to their catalogue ("Wahlfachkatalog"/"WFK"). Using the GUI I can search the courses, check them for validity by comparing them to the courses from the curriculum and add them to my personal list of courses.

Created using
- Python 3
- PyQt5
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
